# Agentic AI BI Platform

## Project Overview

The Agentic AI BI Platform is an intelligent business intelligence system that combines document processing, natural language querying, and AI-powered analytics. The platform allows users to upload business documents, ask questions in natural language, and receive intelligent insights and analysis through an interactive chat interface.

## Architecture

The platform is built with a modern, scalable architecture:

### Frontend
- **Technology Stack**: React 19 with TypeScript, Vite build system
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive styling
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management
- **Charts**: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2 for data visualization

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance API
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, OpenAI integration for natural language processing
- **Document Processing**: Support for PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, and TXT files
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for semantic search and document retrieval
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and caching
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, scikit-learn for data analysis

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization for backend services
- **Environment**: Virtual environments for Python dependencies
- **n8n Integration**: Workflow automation and AI agent coordination
